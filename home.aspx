    <h2>Look at this stuff</h2>
    <p>
        Isn't it neat? Wouldn't you think my collection's complete? Wouldn't you think I'm the girl,
        girl who has everything? Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold?
        Lookin&#39; around here, you&#39;d think, &quot;Sure. She&#39;s got everything.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        I&#39;ve got gadgets and gizmos aplenty. I&#39;ve got whosits and whatsits galore. You want thingamabobs?
        I got twenty. But who cares? No big deal. I want more.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanna be where the people are. I wanna see, wanna see &#39;em dancing. Walkin&#39; around on those—what do
        you call &#39;em? Oh. Feet. Flippin&#39; your fins, you don&#39;t get too far. Legs are required for jumpin&#39;,
        dancin&#39;, strollin&#39; along down the—what&#39;s that word again? Street! Up where they walk, up
        where they run, up where they stay all day in the sun, wanderin&#39; free. Wish I could be part of that world.
    </p>
    <p>
        What would I give if I could live out of these waters? What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand? Bet&#39;cha
        on land, they understand. Bet they don&#39;t reprimand their daughters. Bright, young women, sick of swimmin&#39;,
        ready to stand!
    </p>
    <p>
        I&#39;m ready to know what the people know! Ask &#39;em my questions and get some answers. What&#39;s a fire, and why
        does it—what&#39;s the word—burn? When&#39;s it my turn? Wouldn&#39;t I love, love to explore that shore above?
    </p>
    <p>
        Out of the sea... wish I could be... part of that world.
