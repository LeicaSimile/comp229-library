    <h2>A long, long time ago...</h2>
    <p>
        There was a volcano living all alone in the middle of the sea. He sat high above his bay, watching all
        the people play, and wishing that he had someone too. And from his lava came this song of hope that he
        sang out loud everyday for years and years:
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a dream, I hope will come true, that you&#39;re here with me, and I&#39;m here with you. I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above will send me someone to lava.</p>
